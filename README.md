### What is it? :ballot_box_with_check:
Terminal Chess is an implementation of classical Chess made to be played within a terminal. It was built more for fun than out of neccessity since there are a million and one Chess games already in existence but hey, this one is mine.

### What is it not? :negative_squared_cross_mark:
Terminal Chess is not a super advanced Chess game with a GUI and AI opponents to play against. It does not contain all advanced rules of Chess and should not be taken too seriously.

### Can I contribute? :raised_hand:
Absolutely, I will accept any contributions which improve on or add to the games features in a meaningful way.
